  <p> At dawn, whole fields of sunflowers stand at attention, all facing east, and begin their romance with the rising sun. As that special star appears to move across the sky, young flowers follow its light, looking up, then over and westward, catching one final glance as the sun disappears over the horizon.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>At night, in its absence, the sunflowers face east again, anticipating the sunâ€™s return.</p>
